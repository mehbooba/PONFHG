# PONFHG: Partial Order Neutrosophic Fuzzy Hypergraph for Recommendations
This repository contains the implementation of a recommendation algorithm using Partial Order Neutrosophic Fuzzy Hypergraphs . The dataset used in this project is the COCO dataset, introduced by the paper "COCO: Semantic-Enriched Collection of Online Courses at Scale with Experimental Use Cases".

## Main File
hyper_partial.py: This is the main file that contains the code for the proposed algorithm. It handles the core logic and execution of the Partial Order Neural-Fuzzy Hybrid Graph Algorithm.
## Dataset Information
The dataset used in this implementation is the COCO dataset. The dataset is converted to two files: one containing learner_id, course_id, learner_rating, time_stamp and another file containing average course rating, course frequency, average instructor rating and review polarities. Algorithm uses both the files to run. 

## Access to the Dataset:
To access the dataset, please refer to the original paper and contact the authors for permission. You may need to complete the required formalities for dataset access.
