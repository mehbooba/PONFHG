# PONFHG: Partial Order Neutrosophic Fuzzy Hypergraph for Recommendations
This repository contains the implementation of a recommendation algorithm using Partial Order Neutrosophic Fuzzy Hypergraphs . The dataset used in this project is the Amazon Beauty dataset. 
## Main File
hyper_partial.py: This is the main file that contains the code for the proposed algorithm. It handles the core logic and execution of the Partial Order Neural-Fuzzy Hybrid Graph Algorithm. The dataset is preprocessed using preprocess_dataset.py. The preprocessed dataset is named as beautydataextract and is added to the data folder.
